This is going to be where i write about what i learned, what im practicing, etc....

daily lesson log:

Nov 1st, 2025: today I practiced creating a remote from scratch and pushing code into that remote.
i had trouble initially because i was logging "git push -u origin main" instead of Master..noted.

Nov 2nd: Today i simply added some lines in the js and css files, made a little adding function and merged them both into master, just 
working on remembering this stuff, anyways thats it.
