This is going to be where i write about what i learned, what im practicing, etc....

daily lesson log:

Nov 1st, 2025: today I practiced creating a remote from scratch and pushing code into that remote.
i had trouble initially because i was logging "git push -u origin main" instead of Master..noted.

Nov 2nd: Today i simply added some lines in the js and css files, made a little adding function and merged them both into master, just 
working on remembering this stuff, anyways thats it.

nov 4: i missed yesterday but what i did was work on deploying my password generator and making it open
on a mobile device which it wasn't doing, i'll get it eventually..i wanna move onto something else 
though, learning vercel has been cool, now onto the next topic.

nov 6, 2:21am: today i worked the majority of the day but i still wanna make a little time to get my fingers to code something....little by little, guys.
